# platform-strategy-tests
A repository for the storage of actual platform strategy tests, (not the code).

To import a strategy test into the Platform TUI, paste the raw github file link into the TUI.

To get the raw github file link for a strategy test, click on the file of the strategy you are interested in, right-click on the `Raw` button, and `Copy link address`.

A raw github file link looks like this, for example: `https://github.com/dashpay/platform-strategy-tests/raw/master/documents/50_dashpay_contactInfo_per_second_minFill`.

Note that the raw github file link is the same as the regular file link, except the "blob" directory is replaced with "raw".
