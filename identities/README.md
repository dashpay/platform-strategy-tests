# Identity Strategies

**5_identity_inserts_per_block_while_adding_keys**: Inserts 5 new identities per block (100% chance) as well as adding a new public key to a random identity once per block (10% chance). Running for 60 seconds requires 300 asset lock proofs, so it takes a few minutes to initialize, and even longer if you want to run longer.

**5_identity_inserts_per_second_while_adding_keys**: Registers 30 start identities, then inserts 5 new identities per second (100% chance) as well as adding a new public key to a random identity once per second (10% chance). Running for 60 seconds requires 330 asset lock proofs, so it takes a few minutes to initialize, and even longer if you want to run longer.
